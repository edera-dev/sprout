Sprout is an *EXPERIMENTAL* programmable UEFI bootloader written in Rust.

Sprout is in use at Edera now in development environments and is intended to ship to production soon.

The name "sprout" is derived from our company name "Edera" which means "ivy".
Given that Sprout is the first thing that is inteded to start on an Edera system, the name was apt.
